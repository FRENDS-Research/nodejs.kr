## Global Objects

These object are available in all modules. Some of these objects aren't
actually in the global scope but in the module scope - this will be noted.

### global

The global namespace object.

In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope. That means that in
browsers if you're in the global scope `var something` will define a global
variable. In Node this is different. The top-level scope is not the global
scope; `var something` inside a Node module will be local to that module.

### process

The process object. See the [process object](process.html#process) section.

### console

Used to print to stdout and stderr. See the [stdio](stdio.html) section.


### require()

To require modules. See the [Modules](modules.html#modules) section.
`require` isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.


### require.resolve()

Use the internal `require()` machinery to look up the location of a module,
but rather than loading the module, just return the resolved filename.

### require.cache

Modules are cached in this object when they are required. By deleting a key
value from this object, the next `require` will reload the module.


### require.paths

An array of search paths for `require()`.  This array can be modified to add
custom paths.

Example: add a new path to the beginning of the search list

    require.paths.unshift('/usr/local/node');


### __filename

The filename of the script being executed.  This is the absolute path, and not necessarily
the same filename passed in as a command line argument.

Example: running `node example.js` from `/Users/mjr`

    console.log(__filename);
    // /Users/mjr/example.js

`__filename` isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.

### __dirname

The dirname of the script being executed.

Example: running `node example.js` from `/Users/mjr`

    console.log(__dirname);
    // /Users/mjr

`__dirname` isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.


### module

A reference to the current module. In particular
`module.exports` is the same as the `exports` object. See `src/node.js`
for more information.
`module` isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.


### exports

An object which is shared between all instances of the current module and
made accessible through `require()`.
`exports` is the same as the `module.exports` object. See `src/node.js`
for more information.
`exports` isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.

### setTimeout(cb, ms)
### clearTimeout(t)
### setInterval(cb, ms)
### clearInterval(t)

The timer functions are global variables. See the [timers](timers.html) section.
