## Crypto

Use `require('crypto')` to access this module.

The crypto module requires OpenSSL to be available on the underlying platform.
It offers a way of encapsulating secure credentials to be used as part
of a secure HTTPS net or http connection.

It also offers a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, hmac, cipher, decipher, sign and verify methods.

### crypto.createCredentials(details)

Creates a credentials object, with the optional details being a dictionary with keys:

* `key` : a string holding the PEM encoded private key
* `cert` : a string holding the PEM encoded certificate
* `ca` : either a string or list of strings of PEM encoded CA certificates to trust.

If no 'ca' details are given, then node.js will use the default publicly trusted list of CAs as given in
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt>.


### crypto.createHash(algorithm)

Creates and returns a hash object, a cryptographic hash with the given algorithm
which can be used to generate hash digests.

`algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version
of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are `'sha1'`, `'md5'`, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, etc.
On recent releases, `openssl list-message-digest-algorithms` will display the available digest algorithms.

Example: this program that takes the sha1 sum of a file

    var filename = process.argv[2];
    var crypto = require('crypto');
    var fs = require('fs');

    var shasum = crypto.createHash('sha1');

    var s = fs.ReadStream(filename);
    s.on('data', function(d) {
      shasum.update(d);
    });

    s.on('end', function() {
      var d = shasum.digest('hex');
      console.log(d + '  ' + filename);
    });

### hash.update(data)

string (See the [Buffers](buffers.html) for more information).

### crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)

encoded string (See the [Buffers](buffers.html) for more information).

### cipher.update(data, input_encoding='binary', output_encoding='binary')

and can be `'utf8'`, `'ascii'` or `'binary'`. The `output_encoding` specifies
the output format of the enciphered data, and can be `'binary'`, `'base64'` or `'hex'`.

### cipher.final(output_encoding='binary')

Returns any remaining enciphered contents, with `output_encoding` being one of: `'binary'`, `'base64'` or `'hex'`.

Note: `cipher` object can not be used after `final()` method been called.


### crypto.createDecipher(algorithm, password)

Creates and returns a decipher object, with the given algorithm and key.
This is the mirror of the [createCipher()](#crypto.createCipher) above.

### crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)

### decipher.final(output_encoding='binary')

Returns any remaining plaintext which is deciphered,
with `output_encoding` being one of: `'binary'`, `'ascii'` or `'utf8'`.

Note: `decipher` object can not be used after `final()` method been called.
